It also has 4 bathrooms, exceeding the user's minimum requirement of at least two. Additionally, it comes with a 3-car garage, meeting the user's preference of at least one garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Price**: The price of this house is $500,000, falling within the user's budget range of $500,000 to $800,000 USD.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Size**: The house is 3500 square feet, well above the user's minimum requirement of at least 2000 square feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Amenities**: The house features a backyard with a play area, suitable for gardening, which aligns with the user's preference for a backyard for gardening. While the heating system details are not provided, the house is described as spacious and modern, which could potentially include an energy-efficient heating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Neighborhood**: The house is located in a family-friendly neighborhood known for its excellent schools, parks, and community events. It offers suburban tranquility while still providing access to amenities, which matches the user's preference for a balance between suburban tranquility and urban amenities like restaurants and theaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Transportation**: While specific transportation details are not provided, the neighborhood is described as family-friendly with safe streets, which could imply it is away from busy vehicle roads. Additionally, the neighborhood is ideal for families with children, suggesting it may have bike-friendly roads. Easy access to reliable public transport is not explicitly mentioned but could be feasible in a family-friendly neighborhood.\n",
